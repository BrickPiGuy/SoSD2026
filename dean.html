                    Welcome to the Associate Dean's Corner, where we share insights, perspectives, and reflections on the evolving landscape 
                    of software development education and industry practices. This section provides a space for discussion on how academic 
                    institutions can better prepare students for the challenges and opportunities in modern software development.

                    <p>
                        The purpose of this project was to infuse Git, GitHub Desktop, and GitHub in all applicable Software Development courses. 
                        This allows our students to passively create portfolios. The project is nearing completion, with 400-level courses 
                        currently being edited.

                        The new program was formally presented to the Executive Board. This program will consist of three phases with Phase 1 
                        starting in January. The Course Dog proposal has also begun. Please contact me (Joe) for more information.

                        As part of the new program, a faculty training program will be developed. This allows our Software Dev faculty to become 
                        better acquainted with AI tools, modern development practices, and to learn new skills.

                        I am committed to continuing follow-up studies related to my dissertation and to publish whenever possible. For example: 
                        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06649" target="_blank" style="color: var(--secondary-color); text-decoration: underline;">https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06649</a>

                        The motivation behind this goal is to answer questions I have and to continue my own education.
